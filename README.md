Description
-------------
Implement a yes/no guessing game called 20 Questions using a binary tree. At the beginning of each round of the game,
the human player thunks of an object. The computer tries to guess the object by asking a series of no more than 20 yes-or-no
questions. Eventually the computer guesses what the object is. If this guess is correct, the computer wins, if not the human player wins.

Initially the computer is not very intelligent, but it grows more intelligent with each game. If the computer's answer guess is incorrect
the player must give it a new question to help it in future games. This is similar to the game found at the website http://animalgame.com/
